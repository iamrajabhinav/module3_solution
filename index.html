This chicken hand-pie recipe was viewed more than any other new chicken recipe of 2018. "These easy mini hand-pies are made with biscuit dough, canned chicken, and frozen vegetables for a simple and savory hand-held snack or appetizer," says Christina.2. Creamy Chicken and Shrimp Alfredo

Chicken and shrimp combine in a creamy Alfredo sauce flavored with sun-dried tomatoes, pesto, and garlic. "You'll love my twist on this creamy Alfredo," says Tree Lee. "A perfect match with a nice green salad, and you must have garlic bread to sop up this creamy sauce."3. Creamy Hatch Chile Chicken

New Mexican Hatch chiles are the stars of this easy but flavorful dish also featuring rotisserie chicken, corn, and Mexican crema. "Hatch chiles are in season for only 8 weeks a year, 10 weeks if the weather is extra warm," says Yoly. "Our local markets roast and sell them in 25-lb boxes. We buy 50 lbs every year, package them, and freeze them. This flavorful recipe can be served in tortillas, over rice, or by itself."</p>
